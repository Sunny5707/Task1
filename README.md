This is a simple weather app that lets you check real-time weather conditions for any city in the world. Whether you want to know the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, or weather conditions like rain or sunshine, this app has got you covered.

Using data from the OpenWeatherMap API, the app pulls weather information from their servers and presents it in a clean, easy-to-read format. All you need to do is type in the name of a city, and the app will show you details like the temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit), humidity, wind speed, and more.

The app also offers an interactive, user-friendly interface with icons that reflect the weather conditions, so youâ€™ll know exactly what to expect when you step outside.
